  <h1 class="glitch">The Mirror Licks Back</h1>

  <p>The first time you look in the mirror after someone’s ruined you — like really ruined you — there’s a shine that doesn’t come off. It’s not just sweat or gloss or cake smeared across the small of your back. It’s recognition. And it’s filthy.</p>

  <p>You stood there bare, bent slightly forward, not to present — but to confess. The mirror didn’t blink. It watched. It recorded every flushed cheek and toe curl and ragged moan you didn’t mean to let out. The kind that sounds too close to prayer. Too real.</p>

  <h2>Performance is a Sacrament</h2>
  <p>This wasn’t a game. This was surrender under neon. Shame, but holy. Fingernail impressions left like stigmata. The click of a camera phone somewhere in the dark. A partner who doesn’t just fuck — they witness.</p>

  <p>And you knew it was all being seen. Maybe recorded. Maybe remembered forever. But instead of shame closing the door, you let it in. Let it sit cross-legged at the altar and smear lipstick across your collarbone like war paint.</p>

  <h2>The Sacred Act of Being Watched</h2>
  <p>This wasn’t for them. Or maybe it was. Maybe it always is.</p>

  <p>You performed. You arched and offered and said nothing until your own eyes became unbearable. Until you weren’t sure where your body ended and their gaze began. Until your ass was red and glistening with more than sweat, and your soul was a puddle on the tile floor next to your favorite heels.</p>

  <h2>Undoing the Guilt</h2>
  <p>The guilt came later. It always does. But this time, it stayed outside. This was something else. This was power through exposure. Through surrender. Through being completely fucking seen. Not pretty, not poised, not safe — but alive.</p>

  <p>The mirror didn’t blink. It licked back. And you didn’t flinch.</p>
