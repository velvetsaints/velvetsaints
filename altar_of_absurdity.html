    <h1>Altar of Absurdity</h1>
    <p>You meant to have a scene — instead you’re laughing so hard you can’t breathe. Someone shouted “banana hammock” as a safe word. Lube spilled. A strap broke. Glory be.</p>
    <p>Kink isn’t always poise and posture. Sometimes it’s chaotic. Messy. Unhinged in the best way. That’s the altar of absurdity. Where giggles meet degradation and clowncore kisses back.</p>
    <p>You worship each other not despite the silliness — but because of it. You allow joy to interrupt pain. You welcome weird toys. You bless the bloopers.</p>
    <p>Come kneel at the altar. Bring your glitter floggers and bad puns. It’s time for play, holy and hilarious.</p>
