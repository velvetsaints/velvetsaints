    <h1>Rope Burn Vespers</h1>
    <p>There’s a kind of prayer that comes at the end of rope. Not the binding — but the release. The holy marks that remain. A crosshatch of worship etched into skin.</p>
    <p>This is not about pain. It’s about memory. The way nylon kisses you hours later, how the ghost of pressure lingers. You move, and the ritual moves with you. A bruise becomes a sacrament.</p>
    <p>In the quiet hours, after the knots are untied and the breath returns to slow, there’s something sacred. You touch the places where you were held — and you remember.</p>
    <p>Rope burn vesper service begins when the scene ends. A sip of water. The hush of lotion. Fingertips tracing the divine. Let every mark be a hymn.</p>
