    <h1>Worship Me, Then Ruin Me</h1>
    <p>Don’t just love me. Exalt me. Kneel like I’m the altar. Praise every curve like it’s carved into marble. Make your mouth a sermon and your tongue divine.</p>
    <p>Then — destroy me. With reverence. With intent. Call me good girl and slut in the same breath. Let me dissolve under the weight of your attention and your undoing.</p>
    <p>There’s no contradiction in this duality. This is the sacred ruin. The pedestal that topples on purpose. The holiness of being wanted, then wrecked.</p>
    <p>Consent is key. Worship is art. And the aftermath? That’s the real altar. Where praise turns to shatter and someone whispers, “Thank you.”</p>
