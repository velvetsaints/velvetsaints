    <h1>Midnight Confessional</h1>
    <p>You whisper into the voice note like it’s a prayer. Three minutes, no edits. A truth too raw to text. It crackles like vinyl — fragile, honest, late-night holy.</p>
    <p>This isn’t phone sex. This is something else. The ghost of connection. Confession as kink. The thrill of being heard when no one’s watching.</p>
    <p>Your voice trembles, or maybe it growls. Maybe you tell a secret you swore you wouldn’t. Maybe you just breathe. Heavy. Slow. Wanting.</p>
    <p>Midnight confessional isn’t about climax. It’s about contact. A voice in the dark saying, “I’m here. I hear you. Say more.”</p>
